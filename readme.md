# Using Snapshot to create Cross Region Images

### Documentation
- Documentation of Snapshot:  [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning)  
- Documentation of IBM Cloud CLI: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).   


### General Assumptions:
ï¿¼	IBM Cloud CLI has been installed along with VPC Infrastructure plugin
2 API key with Administrator authority downloaded and accessible at ~/apikey.json  
3 VPC Infrastructure authorization (Reader & Writer Role) to COS instance where images will be stored  
4 s3fsfuse installed and configured with HMAC keys with writer access to destination COS bucket stored at ~/passwd.s3fs   

### CLI Commands
>     snapshot                                                    [Beta] View details of a snapshot  
>     snapshot-create, snapshotc                                  [Beta] Create a snapshot from a volume  
>     snapshot-delete, snapshotd                                  [Beta] Delete snapshots  
>     snapshot-delete-from-source, snapshotsd, snapshots-delete   [Beta] Delete snapshots by source volume  
>     snapshot-update, snapshotu                                  [Beta] Update a snapshot  
>     snapshots                                                   [Beta] List all snapshots  
- **setup-image-server.sh** installs the required plugins, tools, etc and formats the work volume for a centos based server to be used for the image-conversion copy.  
- **create-image.sh**  will create a snapshot based on server name, mount a new volume created from snapshot, create RAW image from volume and convert to and upload QCOW2 image to a COS bucket, and then import it into remote image library in different region.  
- **get-boot-vol.sh** is a script which given a server-name and region, will return the associated instance-id, boot-volume-id, latest snapshot-id, and the original OS version of boot volume image.  
- **snapshot.sh** is a script which given a server-name and region, will create a snapshot of boot volume to be used within-region  

### Terraform
- **provider.tf** configured the appropriate IBM Cloud provider variables and downloads latest provider code.  
- **restore-from-image.tf** is an example Terraform v0.14 plan to deploy an instance from an imported image name.   Modification of variables is required to select placement of region, zone, subnet, and IP.  .14 plan to deploy an instance from an imported image name.   Modification of variables is required to select placement of region, zone, subnet, and IP.
