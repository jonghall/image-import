# Using Snapshot Beta to create Cross Region Images

### Documentation
- Documentation of Snapshot:  [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning)  
- Documentation of IBM Cloud CLI: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).   


### General Assumptions:
1 IBM Cloud CLI has been installed along with VPC Infrastructure plugin  
2 API key with Administrator authority downloaded and accessible at ~/apikey.json  
3 VPC Infrastructure authorization (Reader & Writer Role) to COS instance where images will be stored  
4 s3fsfuse installed and configured with HMAC keys with writer access to destination COS bucket stored at ~/passwd.s3fs   

### CLI Commands
>     snapshot                                                    [Beta] View details of a snapshot  
>     snapshot-create, snapshotc                                  [Beta] Create a snapshot from a volume  
>     snapshot-delete, snapshotd                                  [Beta] Delete snapshots  
>     snapshot-delete-from-source, snapshotsd, snapshots-delete   [Beta] Delete snapshots by source volume  
>     snapshot-update, snapshotu                                  [Beta] Update a snapshot  
>     snapshots                                                   [Beta] List all snapshots  

### Image conversion process
- **setup-image-server.sh** installs the required plugins, tools, etc to create a centos7 based server to be used for the image-conversion.  
- **create-image.sh <server>** creates a snapshot based on a server name, mounts a new volume created from the snapshot,converts to QCOW2, and then imports it into remote image library in other region.  
- **create-image-background.sh** runs in the background, using a REDIS queue, executes image-conversion jobs in the background.  Can be used to run multiple current conversion jobs, and to scale horizontally to multiple servers
- **add-server.sh <server** add server to REDIS queue to be converted by create-image-background.sh.

1. Initiate a snapshot of specified server boot volume
2. Create volume from snapshot and attaches to image server
3. Waits for volume to be attached and accessiblem, determins device attach location (/dev/vdX)
4. Executed `qemu-img conver` to read RAW volume and write compressed QCOW2 image to COS bucket
5. Imports newly created image as server-latest from COS bucket into image library 
6. If existing image exists in Library, renames to server-created_at_date
7. Detach volume used for image and delete

### known limitations
- even though temporary volume is created with auto-delete=true, volumes are not automatically deleted on detach.  Script currently manually deletes all volumes.
- script does not delete COS images
- script does not delete old image library images
- cos image names:  latest image for each server is always prepended with -latest, older images named with image-import date (does not match snapshot date)

### Other useful utilities
- **get-boot-vol.sh** returns the associated instance-id, boot-volume-id, latest snapshot-id, and the original OS version of boot volume image.  
- **snapshot.sh** creates a snapshot of boot volume to be used within-region.  

### Terraform
Terraform v0.14.10 IBM Cloud Plugin >= 1.21.   
Plans in each directory provide a sampe of how to build and recover servers from created images.  Variables should be configured as needed.
- **build-image-server** Terraform plan to create conversion server(s).
- **tf_create**  Terraform plan to provision 8 test servers into existing production VPC.  
- **tf_recover**  Terraform plan, after creating images and importing into alternate region, creates a VPC, Zone, and Subnet based on original VPC and provisions the 8 servers from each server-latest image.
